Instead, a huge digestive system diagram on the wall.<br/><br/>Weird, right?<br/><br/>I sat down ready for a prescription. Instead:<br/><br/><strong>\"When's the last time you thought about your gut health?\"<br/><br/></strong>I laughed. \"I'm here for my face. I can't turn my camera on at work anymore.\"<br/><br/>\"I know. But tell me—bloating? Gas? Food sensitivities you didn't have five years ago?\"<br/><br/>How did she know?<br/><br/>\"Here's what nobody tells you,\" she said, leaning forward. <strong>\"Your skin isn't the problem. It's the messenger.\"<br/><br/></strong>She pulled up a diagram showing two gut linings—one smooth, one looking like Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>\"This is what I see in 80% of patients with inflammatory skin. Your gut lining is permeable. Food particles and toxins leak into your bloodstream. Your body sees them as invaders and launches an immune response. <strong>And here's the kicker—70% of your immune system lives in your gut. When that barrier breaks down, inflammation doesn't stay local. It goes systemic. And your skin, as your largest organ, bears the brunt.\"<br/><br/></strong>My stomach dropped. \"So everything I've been doing—\"<br/><br/>\"Is like mopping the floor while the sink overflows.\"<br/><br/><strong>Fuck.</strong></p>",

The most concentrated gut-healing compound in nature.\"<br/><br/>I could feel my face grimacing. \"You want me to drink... cow breast milk?\"<br/><br/>\"Think about newborns—perfect skin, pristine gut lining. Colostrum literally builds and seals the digestive system from scratch. It has immunoglobulins that strengthen your gut barrier, growth factors that repair damaged tissue, compounds that calm immune overreactions. <strong>And unlike probiotics, which are like throwing seeds on concrete, colostrum actually rebuilds the foundation those bacteria need to survive.\"<br/><br/>I was so skeptical I almost walked out.<br/><br/></strong>This felt very \"celery juice and chakras.\" Very Instagram wellness guru. Not scientific.<br/><br/>But then she said: \"Sarah, you've spent over three thousand dollars treating the symptom. Give me 90 days and $60 a month to treat the cause. <strong>If nothing changes, I'll personally refund you and buy you the fanciest face cream in this office.\"<br/><br/></strong>What did I have to lose?</p>",
