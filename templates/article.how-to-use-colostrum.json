Today, scientists are increasingly confirming these benefits, linking colostrum’s high concentration of immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, growth factors, and micronutrients to positive outcomes in both athletic performance and everyday wellness. If you read our first article, you already know that colostrum offers much more than simple nutrition: it can help rejuvenate the gut lining, support the body’s defense system, and potentially enhance muscle recovery.As colostrum becomes more readily available in powder or capsule form, individuals can incorporate it into their routine just as they would a protein shake or daily multivitamin. But exactly how you use colostrum—and in what quantities—can significantly influence your results.<\/p>",

Some people may experience mild digestive upset initially—gassiness or bloating—as their body adapts to the new proteins. These effects often subside after the first week, especially if you start with a lower dose.<\/p><p>Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should discuss colostrum use with a healthcare professional, given limited research in these specific populations. Additionally, those with compromised immune systems or autoimmune conditions should seek medical guidance on whether colostrum is appropriate for them.<\/p>",
